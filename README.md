## Week 6 Homework

# Description

The main purpose of this project is to create a webpage that will allow the user to see the weather in multiple cities and the 5-day forecast.

To enable the user to look up the weather and forecast, I will be using multiple APIs to retrieve the requested data. I will also be using Bootstrap to style the webpage.

The webpage is designed so that the current weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV Index, and the weather icon) will be displayed when a city is entered into the search bar and the search button pressed. In addition to the current weather, the 5-day forecast (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and the weather icon) will be displayed under the current weather.
